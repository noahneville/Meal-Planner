    "pairingText": "Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Beef. Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. One wine you could try is Maddalena Merlot. It has 4.8 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.",
